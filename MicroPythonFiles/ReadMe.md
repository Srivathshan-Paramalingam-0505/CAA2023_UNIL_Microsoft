 # Interface.py
 In this file, you will have the code for the different functionalities we tried using the M5Stack Core2 device. We had the opportunity to add the GPS unit to the device to retrieve GPS data (Latitude, Longitude, Altitude, Speed converted from knots to km/h). We set a timer so the data does not overflow. We decided to implement the remote feature to start and stop the device with the GPS unit.

# Final_GpsApplication
In this file, the idea was to merge the graphical elements from the first file, with the external functionality we want to use, such as our Cloud function "generate_step_info".
